Problem:
    The Payroll Department keeps a list of employee information for each pay period in a text file.
    The format of each line of the file is the following: <last name> <hourly wage> <hours worked>
    Write a program that inputs a filename from the user and prints to the terminal a report of the wages paid to the employees for the given period.
    The report should be in tabular format with the appropriate header.
    Each line should contain an employeeâ€™s name, the hours worked, and the wages paid for that period.
Solution:
