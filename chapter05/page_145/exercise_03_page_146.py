Problem:
    What is a mutator method? Explain why mutator methods usually return the value None.
Solution:
    Mutator methods are called to change the state of an object.
    These methods usually return the value None.
    This value is automatically returned by any function or method that does not have a return statement.
    
    Suppose you forget that sort mutates a list, and instead you mistakenly think that it builds and returns a new, sorted list and leaves the original list unsorted.
