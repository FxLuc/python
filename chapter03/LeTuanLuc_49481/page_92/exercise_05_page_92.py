Problem:
    What is the maximum number of guesses necessary to guess correctly a given number between the numbers N and M?
Solution:
    By starting at the midpoint between the two initial numbers and eliminating half the remaining numbers with each incorrect guess.
    Ideally, the user should be able to guess the correct number in no more than log 2 (upper â€“ lower 1 1) attempts.
