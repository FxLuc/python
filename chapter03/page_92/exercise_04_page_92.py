Problem:
    Describe the purpose of the break statement and the type of problem for which it is well suited.
Solution:
    The break statement can be used to exit a while loop from its body.
    The break statement is usually used when the loop must perform at least one iteration.
    The loop headerâ€™s condition in that case is the value True.
    The break statement is nested in an if statement that tests for a termination condition.
