Problem:
    Where are module variables, parameters, and temporary variables introduced and initialized in a program?
Solution:
    A module variable, whether it names a function or a datum, is introduced and receives its initial value at the top level of the module.
    A parameter is introduced in a function header and receives its initial value when the function is called.
    A temporary variable is introduced in an assignment statement within the body of a function definition.
