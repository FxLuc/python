Problem:
    Explain how an algorithm solves a general class of problems and how a function definition can support this property of an algorithm.
Solution:
    The summation function contains both the code for the summation algorithm and the means of supplying problem instances to this algorithm.
    The problem instances are the data sent as arguments to the function.
    The parameters or argument names in the functionâ€™s header behave like variables waiting to be assigned data whenever the function is called.
