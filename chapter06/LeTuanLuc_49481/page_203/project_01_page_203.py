Problem:
    Package Newtonâ€™s method for approximating square roots (Case Study 3.6) in a function named newton.
    This function expects the input number as an argument and returns the estimate of its square root.
    The script should also include a main function that allows the user to compute square roots of inputs until she presses the enter/return key.
Solution:
    >>>

        estimate = (estimate + x / estimate) / 2
        difference = abs(x - estimate ** 2)
