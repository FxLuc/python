Problem:
    Describe the processes of top-down design and stepwise refinement. Where does the design start, and how does it proceed?
Solution:
    Top-down design is a strategy that decomposes a complex problem into simpler subproblems and assigns their solutions to functions.
    In top-down design, we begin with a top-level main function and gradually fill in the details of lower-level functions in a process of stepwise refinement.
