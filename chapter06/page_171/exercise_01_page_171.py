Problem:
    Anne complains that defining functions to use in her programs is a lot of extra work.
    She says she can finish her programs much more quickly if she just writes them using the basic operators and control statements.
    State three reasons why her view is shortsighted.
Solution:
    1. A function eliminates redundant patterns of code by specifying a single place where the pattern is defined.
    2. A function serves as an abstraction mechanism by allowing us to view many things as one thing.
    3. A function hides a complex chunk of code in a single named entity.
