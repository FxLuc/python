Problem:
    Write a line of code that prompts the user for his or her name and saves the user’s input in a variable called name.
Solution:
    As you create programs in Python, you’ll often want your programs to ask the user for input.
    You can do this by using the input function. This function causes the program to stop and wait for the user to enter a value from the keyboard.
    When the user presses the return or enter key, the function accepts the input value and makes it available to the program.
    A program that receives an input value in this manner typically saves it for further processing.

name = input('Enter your name: ')
print('Your name is: ', name)
