Problem:
    Explain what goes on behind the scenes when your computer runs a Python program.
Solution:
    When a Python program is executed,
    the interpreter reads a Python expression or statement and verifies that it is well formed, then translated into byte code.
    This byte code is then sent to the Python virtual machine (PVM) for further interpretation and execution.
