Problem:
    -> Write and test a program that computes the area of a circle.

    It should use the formula 3.14 * radius ** 2 to compute the area and then output this result suitably labeled.
Solution:
    >>>
"""
radius = float(input('Enter radius of circle: '))
print('The area of a circle =', 3.14 * radius ** 2)
