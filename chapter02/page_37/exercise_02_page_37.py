Problem:
    Jack says that he will not bother with analysis and design but proceed directly to coding his programs. Why is that not a good idea?
Solution:
    Programs rarely work as hoped and will have mistkes at the first time they are run.
    A mistake detected often requires the developer to back up and redo some of the work.
    Keep in mind that mistakes found early are much less expensive to correct than those found late.
    These are not just financial costs but also costs in time and effort.
    It can be reduced by careful analysis, design, and implementation.
