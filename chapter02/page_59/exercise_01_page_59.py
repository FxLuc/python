Problem:
    Explain the relationship between a function and its arguments.
Solution:
    A function call consists of a function’s name and its arguments or parameters.
    When it is called, the function’s arguments are evaluated, and these values are passed to the function’s code for processing.
    When the function completes its work, it may return a result value to the caller.
