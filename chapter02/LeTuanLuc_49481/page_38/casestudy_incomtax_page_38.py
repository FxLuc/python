Problem:
    The customer requests a program that computes a personâ€™s income tax.
    Input the gross income and number of dependents
    Compute the taxable income using the formula
    Taxable income = gross income - 10000 - (3000 * number of dependents)
    Compute the income tax using the formula
    Tax = taxable income * 0.20
    Print the tax
Solution:
    1. Significant constants
        tax rate
        standard deduction
        deduction per dependent
    2. The inputs are
        gross income
        number of dependents
    3. Computations:
        taxable income = gross income - the standard deduction - a deduction for each dependent
        income tax = is a fixed percentage of the taxable income
    4. The outputs are
        the income tax
