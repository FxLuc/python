Problem:
    Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who like to buy LP record albums.
    The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and oldies for $2.00 a night.
    Write a program that the clerks at Five Star Retro Video can use to calculate the total charge for a customerâ€™s video rentals.
    The program should prompt the user for the number of each type of video and output the total
cost.
Solution:
    1. Input the type.
    2. Compute the total charge using the formula
        total charge += costs of type videos rents.
    3. Print the total charge.
